# Fantasy World

This repo contains a script to make a single-file version of the tabletop
RPG Fantasy World. In the [Release page](https://github.com/pocomane/fantasy-world-pdf/releases/latest)
there are PDFs and single file HTML for both english and italian languages.

If you want to run the script by your own, you need an unix system with
lua, lua-socket and weasyprint.
